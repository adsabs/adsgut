o get tests to use memory database, and set memory datbase to init_db like the other
get itemtypes and tagtypes into the association classes
o also what we want to associate into a group is a tag posting, not a tag
support in posts.py for the new tables
o the get funcs return dicts in different ways. Standardize

Use flask shell extension
read up flask blueprints, put it under prefix. Use url_for inside templates or things will break.
create a __init__.py

flask_login is what Giovanni wantes to use
So i need to work with flask login
Add a adscookieid into the user. This will interface to Giovanni's flask_login
The nick maps to that adscookieid. The adscookieid can be use in place of nick, nick resolves to it.

blueprint has local static and templates. make sure template names are namespaced, as templates go bottom up
static goes from top to bottom...templates from bottom to top

BUGS:
one must escape tag text, especially / and :

Add ordering a lot of things by time. thus add time into results. How to intriduce ordering into api. A special criterion?

Needed now:
(a) put in time ordering
(b) permits
(c) error handling
(d) finally, simple routing (later)
(e) finally, groups in applications (later)
(f) get it in Giovanni mode
(g) textual setup stuff for bottstrapping the app
(h) deletions...simple ones

Requirements from ADS libraries
(1) tag having last creation date
(2) tag description
(3) number of entries for that tag => put in a count(*) on all web services where appropriate
(4) add a ads/note type
(5) facet creation through tags: support a sql IN query

Web service support needed:
(a) am i saved. Given item, is it saved by user, based on itemname, or itemuri x
(b) groups and apps an item is posted to x [What about groups and apps a tag is posted to: BUG]
(c) tags for a item x
(d) groups for a user not including public, default, and app groups x (just get from all groups right now TODO)
(e) is an item saved publicly? (check the groupsin? x TODO: add a boolean for this)
(f) create a new group x make invite x
(g) accept invitation to group x
(h) given Giovanni's information create a user: func or API? In anycase need a is USer inDatabase func
(i) TOTALLY FORGOT: add web services for POSTING items into groups and apps (we have this, dont we?)

html pages desired
(a) private libraries page
(b) private librariy for a group page
(c) profile page


================================================================
Stuff to be done now (not next year, ie no app pages etc)
[not clear whether one should expose anything about app to users]
BIG: (a) ordering of item results, asc and desc by time. counts. [we are on ordering but dont have counts] (s) we need counts and pagination later
(b) html pages: private library, personal profile (for grps invitations, etc), group priv library
BIG(c) API:deletion web services(simple) for item/tag in group, item/tag in app, item/tag for user (user priv grp)
(d) API: is an item saved publically (we could parse from groups saved in)
--(e) convert giovanni user to rahul user. And work it in giovanni mode.
BIG(f) rationalize currentuser vas user being masqueraded as (useras)
(g) complex permits and any routing? (none now) -X
(h) textual bootstrap rather than setup python files. --X[use initialize vs testing for now]
BIG(i) shifting stuff from old pub libs in here. Ask alberto for dump. (see email)
write script to bring that stuff in)
--(j) ads libs: see requiremenys from ads libraries.
(h) error handling set of errors: perhaps not needed now -X
--(i) sqlite AND MySQL support.
BIG(j) document document document (code + api) (k) item tags philosophy document. How notes are set up. 
--(l) how tags are published: web service for omnibus publishing vs  group posting prefernce.
(m) clean up additional unused fields in tables -X
--(n) a general item.groupsin is a leak: you ought to only show groups you are a member of..(q) All items will currently give groups and such. Perhaps this should be suppressed.
(o) all POSTS will fail to return appropriate info about the object unless you commit the object into the dbase as part of post in test --X
(p) cant sort on itemtype as its a different table join --X
BIG(r) we do not support range or IN queries for searching. If we use filter instead of filter_by we ought to be able to do that.
BIG(s) JS client library taking use cases into a/c.
=================================================================
BIG THING ON ROUTING
Since we have no routing, we have no match between the itemtype and the app autopost. Eg an ads/pub needs to
be autoposted to the ads pubs app. Lets hardcode this into the itemtype. Additional postings require routing, but we have only one app for now.
But then we dont need this, as we can just go with all items. But why not support the correct interface? We do now.



BEEEEG things that need painstaking decisionmaking:
(a) currentuser vs useras
(b) tags posting vs items posting
(c) A question is this: how do we arrange commits like when we did redis so that we dont have partial updates. as big a question as the tag vs item
and currentuser vs useras

USE CASES
----------
(a) on web site urer takes item, saves it. 
then tags it. then posts into group. tags must also be posted into group
or posts into group. then tags it. tags must again be posted into group
the individual web services for ragging or group posting do not take care of this. routing could be used.
but we dont have  routing right now. thus we could instrument the funcs. this seems like a bad idea. what if we change policy.
we could also rely on the user interface to do it as a result of the ajax success response. Go with that, and 
TODO: provide a function to do this in js, with callback capability. This indeed is the best for ADS too.
LONG TERM doing this server side is better. maybe we should do routing now? Atleast a simplified form.

(b)Also what about things like multiple groups at a time? sounds like a reason for dealing with arrays in POST. currently we explicitly
POST to groups with a group endpoint, but it might be worth doing as an array to an item or tag or itemtag endpoint. In terms of the usecase,
a select box with multiple groups, we'd dsave item, tag in, and post stuff to multiple groups. Also ad the ability to simultaneously post multiplw tags to an item

(c) now lets tackle the use case of a note being added. this is just like another tag.so writing a note on an item is like making a tag on that item. However, the note might want to be held private, or posted to the groups (or made public..which is just another group, so lets not worry about that). For note to be held private, put a checkbox which says keep note private, which then will post the tag only into the personal group. This then is an argument
for separating tagging from posting tagging to groups. In other words, even if item X is scheduled to be posted to N groups i might want to keep note private. So how does this play with A?

Its obvious than one omnibus is not the solution. But we do want to make things easy for the client.


ERRORS:
running outside of app context in script due to http error handling

DELETIONS get even more whack when we start adding stuff to groups and all.
There is no api validation to make sure junk is not being sent in.


Criticals for Mon:
(a) where we want items, make sure items dosent send down tags and such. LATER
(b) a pythonic api to add users in bulk and other things SOON

this turns out to be very hard to do via pure decorators with g.db and the request object. perhaps a class is needed to front the 
currentuser, g.db, g.dbp, and request objects. this class could then carry state in both the web and pythoniac api's. [g.class]
(c) proper currentuser/useras dance and the permit raj wed/thu
(d) continual scanning of BUG's in whosflask and whos and posts TUENIGHT
(e) fix the userthere situation for some of the web apis. done
(f) validation of web based input (or maybe at api func level too is a must) SOON
(g) run as a blueprint application LATER
(h) error handling as pythonic request or while running posts.py(or whos.py) as opposed to werkzeug error handling LATER
(i) tags vs taggings for items TUE
(j) orderbys currently have duplicates.	LATER
(k) make tagmode the default and test. TUE [testing is left to be done yet]
(l) go over use cases in head and see if we satisfy. Seems itemsandtags for eg need a multi. In this case check if work of routing is done multiply TUENOW
(m) dont we want small API func which give numbers for a tag and such like we had in the redis version? these could do tag purely by name too
perhaps this can be run off the spec funcs? i think so. do this as we make the ui.


===============
addUserToGroup dosent get permission from user to add. same as addUserToApp.
Whats the use case for this?Bulk adds? and whats the permitting issues?


immeds:
(a) appsin gives wring thing for item.info() (also groupsin)[DONE, helps tagmode too]
(b) support get for invitations. merge
(c) use or notuse for tagmode: dont use tagmode for notes?
(d) should uerthere be needed if u ask for tag for item is you have the tag ns
eg http://127.0.0.1:5000/items/rahuldave/ads/tag:stupid?userthere=rahuldave
keep it for now, think about it deeply

more immeds:
counts and pagination: do not error if page*pagination > count. return empty array
counts done pagination scaffolding done, querying waits
group by or etc to make results in apps or groups dups or not decision:
	reason is igu uniqueness, not ig uniqueness, and we'd like the ui for items in a group
	to not be repeating items when multiple people posted them
	we could currently leave this to js but then pagination will confuse
	best dont in getItems and criterion, also maybe for groupsin and such
	think i will punt on this for later.
need to support tagmode in query and pass down. Also add page. perhaps add pagesize? how
	we do rate limiting?
validation: page etc shouldnt be stupid stuff

tagmode in POSTS, not in GET. need it to prevent group propagation for notes.
